b)  print(1)                                          1
c)  print(1 + 2)                                      3
d)  print("1" + "2")                                  "3"                                             yes; combined numbers instead of adding
e)  print("this" + " " + "is" + " " +                 this is a sentence.                              no spaces

    "sentence" + ".")

Part 2 - Variables Practice
1. In your Console
Type and run the following:
    animal = "dogs"
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following:
    1. What happens?   says 'dogs are really cool.'
    2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead? set animal="cats"

2. In your Console
Type and run the following code:
print(dogs + " are cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following questions:
    1. What output does this produce?  a syntax error
    2. Why does this happen?  'dogs' is not defined/ dogs is not part of a string
